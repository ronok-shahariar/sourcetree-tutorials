It features an intuitive graphical interface for repositories bridging the gap between a user and a Git. Utilizing technology you will quickly master repository. As to mature developers, they will also benefit from using the sourcetree as it allows them to focus on writing code and being more productive.

##Ques 3: How to Use SourceTree?
```
For instance, you can start by creating a project on Github and then connect it to your SourceTree software so that later on, 
when you update your code or include new code you can upload the data on Github using SourceTree.

1. To start work with SourceTree, create new project on GitHub (click 'Start a Project'.)
   Then you will need to fill in various information in the repository. This is necessary to leave clear prompts for people 
   associated with the project.
2. You need to name the repository. Then briefly describe what is the repository all about.
3. Defining the visibility of your repository, you have two options - make it Public or Private. If you mark your repository 
   as public, anyone around the world can see your repository, clone it, and start working on your projects. If you keep it private, 
   your repository can't be shared by anyone other than team members associated with you.
4. Then you need to initialize your repository with README, which is basically a file that defines a list of information. Doing that, 
   you will be able to create a new repository with a README file on click.All your available repositories will be visible on the left 
   side of the dashboard.
```

## Steps:
```
step 1:
       From the main repository page, select the Clone or download button and copy the URL.
       This will either be the SSH or HTTPS URL, depending on how you authenticate to GitHub. 
       If you're not sure how your account is authenticated, use the HTTPS URL.

Step 2:
       Back in SourceTree, select File > New from the main menu.
     OR
       Select +New from the Repository Browser.

Step 3:
       Select a Destination Path for your local copy. Make sure the folder is empty. 
       Select the button with the ellipsis to change the destination path. You can name it anything 
       you want in the Name field or just leave it the same as the repo name.
